    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Very simple italian cookie. That is quick to make and more importantly,<br/> 
    does not transform the whole kitchen in to a "No mans land".</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>250g flour</li>
        <li>2-3g baking powder</li>
        <li>Pinch of salt</li>
        <li>Zest of 1 lemon or orange</li>
        <li>120-175g sugar (depends on how sweet you want them<br/>
            or how sweet are your additions)</li>
        <li>One of three options:
            <ol style="list-style-type: circle;">
                <li>3 eggs</li>
                <li>2 eggs + 55g butter</li>
                <li>2 eggs + 40g ghee</li>
            </ol>
        </li>
        <li>One of these options:
            <ol style="list-style-type: circle;">
                <li>120g almonds</li>
                <li>40g poppy seeds + 100g raisins</li>
                <li>120g raisins</li>
                <li>100g rough chopped dark chocolate (at least 60% cacao)</li>

            </ol>
        </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Take a deep bowl, place it on a scales and sift in it the flour,<br/>
             the baking powder and the salt.</li>
        <li>Now take another bowl, put it on scales (don't forget to press tare)<br/> 
            and in it zest the citrus with microplane and add the sugar.</li>
        <li>Depending on the option chosen add 1 egg or the butter or ghee and<br/>
             start mixing using electric mixer. Start slow and go to high.<br/>
         After 30 seconds add the rest of the eggs.</li>
        <li>Turn on the oven to 180&#8451.</li>
        <li>Once the mixture is homogeneous and aerated (should take<br/>
             about 2-3 minutes of mixing) add the additives (nuts/dry fruits/chocolate)<br/>
             and using a silicone spatula mix them in.</li>
        <li>Sift in the flour in to the wet ingredient bowl and using<br/>
             silicone spatula mix them together.</li>
        <li>Transfer the dough on to baking sheet lined with baking paper<br/>
        and shape the dough in to a log (use wet hands to help you).</li>
        <li>Once the oven is hot enough, place and bake cookie log for 25-30 minutes<br/>
        (the log should have gained some color).</li>
        <li>Remove cookie log from the oven and turn down the oven to 160&#8451.</li>
        <li>After 10 minutes remove the cookie log on to a cutting board <br/>
            (be careful, it is still hot) and cut the log about 3cm apart.</li>
        <li>Place them on one side back on the baking sheet and put them back<br/>
        in to the oven for 10-20 minutes (depends on how crunchy you want the<br/>
         outside to be.</li>
        <li>After the time is up remove and flip them on to the other side and </br>
        bake them again for 10-20 minutes (this time should be shorter).</li>
        <li>Remove and place them on a wire cooling rack (no soggy bottoms)<br/>
            and after another 15 minutes they should be cool enough to enjoy with </br>
            coffee.
    </ol>
